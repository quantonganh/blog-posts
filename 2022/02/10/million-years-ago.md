Vừa lên xe thì nghe được đoạn guitar hay quá, vội lấy điện thoại ra ghi âm lại (sợ về nhà không Gúc ra bài gì).
25 tuổi mà bạn ấy viết lời hay thật đấy!

[![Adele - Million Years Ago (Acoustic Cover by Emir Taha)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/riEAnLur96c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riEAnLur96c)

I only wanted to have fun\
Learning to fly, learning to run\
I let my heart decide the way\
When I was young\

Deep down, I must have always known\
That this would be inevitable\
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay\
And bare my soul\

I know I'm not the only one\
Who regrets the things they've done\
Sometimes I just feel it's only me\
Who can't stand the reflection that they see\

I wish I could live a little more\
Look up to the sky, not just the floor\
I feel like my life is flashing by\
And all I can do is watch and cry\

I miss the air, I miss my friends\
I miss my mother, I miss it when\
Life was a party to be thrown\
But that was a million years ago\

When I walk around all of the streets\
Where I grew up and found my feet\
They can't look me in the eye\
It's like they're scared of me\

I try to think of things to say\
Like a joke or a memory\
But they don't recognize me now\
In the light of day\

I know I'm not the only one\
Who regrets the things they've done\
Sometimes I just feel it's only me\
Who never became who they thought they'd be\

I wish I could live a little more\
Look up to the sky, not just the floor\
I feel like my life is flashing by\
And all I can do is watch and cry\

I miss the air, I miss my friends\
I miss my mother, I miss it when\
Life was a party to be thrown\
But that was a million years ago\
A million years ago\
