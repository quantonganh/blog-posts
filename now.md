After taking some time to refresh myself and going on a road trip through Vietnam, I returned to the office to work as a Platform Engineer for a company in Hanoi. I'm learning to [write an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/) while continuing to read [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). I'm building an all-in-one troubleshooting tool named [diagtree](https://github.com/quantonganh/diagtree), where I turn nearly any command into a tree, helping me quickly debug multiple services across different environments, from local to testing, and production.

I still playing table tennis every day (thanks to my wife), and we plan to go swimming once a week since summer is comming.
I'm practising mindfulness in daily activities - eating, walking or talking with friends.

It has been a touch year since I had to undergo surgery that affected my vocal cords, and it took nearly two months to recover. Here's the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEehczTvzSc) that helped me get through that difficult time.
