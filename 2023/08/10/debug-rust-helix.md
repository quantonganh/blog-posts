Helix supports debugging Rust by default using [lldb-vscode](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/lldb/tools/lldb-vscode).
However, there is an issue where [string variables are displayed as memory addresses](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/7007) instead of their actual values:

Noticing that [CodeLLDB natively supports visualization of most common Rust data types](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/blob/master/MANUAL.md#rust-language-support),
I would like to give it a try.

Here's the step-by-step process:

Download the CodeLLDB extension:

```sh
$ cd ~/Downloads/
$ wget https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/releases/download/v1.9.2/codelldb-aarch64-darwin.vsix
```

Setup the extension:

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.local
$ set fish_user_paths /Users/quantong/.local/extension/adapter $fish_user_paths
$ codelldb
```

If you encountered this error:

```sh
$ codelldb
Error: "\"dlopen(/Users/quantong/.local/extension/lldb/lib/liblldb.dylib, 0x0009): 
tried: \\'/Users/quantong/.local/extension/lldb/lib/liblldb.dylib\\' (code signature in <71492E0A-B915-3776-BCB8-266C07A85228> 
\\'/Users/quantong/.local/extension/lldb/lib/liblldb.dylib\\' not valid for use in process: library load disallowed by system policy)\""
```

Remove attributes using `xattr`:

```sh
$ xattr -cr ~/.local/extension/
```

Retry launching:

```sh
$ codelldb --port 13000
```

Switch to use `codelldb` by adding the following to `~/.config/helix/languages.toml`:

```toml
[[language]]
name = "rust"

[language.debugger]
command = "codelldb"
name = "codelldb"
port-arg = "--port {}"
transport = "tcp"

[[language.debugger.templates]]
name = "binary"
request = "launch"

[[language.debugger.templates.completion]]
completion = "filename"
name = "binary"

[language.debugger.templates.args]
program = "{0}"
runInTerminal = false
```

```sh
$ hx --health rust
Configured language server: rust-analyzer
Binary for language server: /opt/homebrew/bin/rust-analyzer
Configured debug adapter: codelldb
Binary for debug adapter: /Users/quantong/.local/extension/adapter/codelldb
Highlight queries: ✓
Textobject queries: ✓
Indent queries: ✓
```

Create a new cargo package:

```sh
$ cargo new hello_cargo
```

Open `src/main.rs` and add the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "world";
    let x = 2;
    let b = true;
    println!("Hello, {} {} {}!", s, x, b);
}
```
Build your code by running:

```sh
$ cargo build
```

The executable will be places in the `target/debug` directory.

In the Helix editor, use the following steps for debugging:

- Press `<Space>` and then `g` to go to Debug.
- Press `b` to toggle breakpoint.
- Press `l` to launch debug target.
- Enther the binary path `target/debug/hello_cargo` and press Enter.

After a few seconds, you'll see the actual value of string variables:
