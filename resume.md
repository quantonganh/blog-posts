## Software Engineer / DevOps Engineer

I am an experienced and versatile software and DevOps engineer with over a decade of expertise in the industry, including exposure to Golang, gRPC, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.

As a passionate advocate for Go, I appreciate its native concurrency support, streamlined compilation process, and the power behind its simplicity and extensive standard library, enabling the development of scalable, high-performance, and robust backend systems.

My personal development projects include building my blog from scratch, automating CI/CD by cross-compiling to arm64, and deploying on a Raspberry Pi in my home.
