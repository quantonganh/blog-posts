Hi, I'm Quan.

I began my career as a .NET developer, but my passion for Linux and open-source software led me to pursue a career in system administration.
Over the years, I gained extensive Linux experience and eventually transitioned into software engineering.
In my spare time, I enjoy teaching my wife how to program to [optimize her office tasks](../../../2021/06/10/automate-office-tasks).

I am motivated by roles that make a positive impact on people's lives or offer opportunities to help others.

Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is important to me. I make a point of leaving work on time to pick up my child from school, allowing us to catch up on our days during the drive home.
We enjoy traveling together, collecting stories, and adding passport stamps along the way.

My favorite sports are table tennis, swimming, and badminton. Although public speaking is a fear of mine, [I can sometimes sing](https://youtu.be/4pxr5zTRgmM). I also have a love for nature and street photography.
